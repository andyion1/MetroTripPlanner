# Metro Trip Planner - Andy Ionita, 2333068

This web application helps users plan metro trips by selecting start and end stations.  
It displays all stations between them on the line. It shows markers on a map and even provides Wikipedia info for each station.

## Requirements

- **Start and End Stations**
    - Choosing a start station and an end station shows all stations between them on the same line.
    - End station choices are limited to stations on the same line as the start.

    - Metro stations are displayed as map markers.
    - Clicking a marker highlights the station and fetches info from the Wikipedia API.
    - Popup shows station details.

- **Station Data**
    - Uses STM geojson file as data source.
    - Server reads the file once and caches it in memory.
    - Data only includes relevant metro lines.
    - On server start: read the file; if successful, server starts listening.

- **React UI**
    - Dropdown forms to select start and end stations.
    - Map component with markers, lines, and popups.
    - When form data changes â†’ update map and re-read updated data.
